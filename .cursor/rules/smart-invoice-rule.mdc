# SmartSeikyu Core Requirements

## Purpose
Invoice generation process optimization

## Background
Currently processing customer usage data exported as CSV from Metrics site for billing data processing, but there's risk of human errors, so we want to automate this process

## Cursor Development Rules
- The main programming language to be used is TypeScript.
- The framework to be used is React.
- The application must be built to ensure proper operation and compatibility with Google Chrome.
- Unused code should be removed as much as possible.
- Components and methods that seem to be reusable should be designed with reusability (commonization) in mind from the beginning.
- Comments should be written to prioritize code readability.
- We aim to optimize the build process for speed and lightweight performance.
- When selecting libraries, priority should be given to those that are the most widely used in web development and available for free.
- For team development, the versions of npm and Node.js must be fixed to ensure consistency across environments.
